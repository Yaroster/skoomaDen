I recently tried Grand Yunnan Impérial, a black tea from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

Preparation:

- **Temperature:** 205°F / 96°C
- **Time:** 0 min, 15 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 5 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 ml

## Overview

After a disappointing initial attempt with a steep time of 45 seconds resulting in strong bitterness, I decided to switch to Gong Fu style brewing to explore the tea's potential further.

### First Infusion (10s)

For the first infusion, I steeped the tea for about 10 seconds, aiming to quickly extract the flavor without letting it become bitter.

### Second Infusion (15s)

The second infusion was very relaxing, with the expected bitterness for a black tea. However, it didn't exhibit any outstanding characteristics beyond being a standard Yunnan black tea.

### Third Infusion (10s)

The third infusion revealed the tea's potential as the bitterness subsided, leaving a lighter and more enjoyable experience. This infusion was particularly praised.

### Fourth Infusion (25s)

With the fourth infusion, the bitterness became more pronounced, but no significant difference was noted compared to the third infusion.

## Overall Impression 

In conclusion, Grand Yunnan Impérial proved to be a non-exceptional yet pleasant black tea. It exhibited slightly less bitterness than expected, making it suitable for casual consumption.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 12/30 - The tea provided some enjoyable moments, particularly in shorter infusions, but it lacked distinctive or exceptional flavors that set it apart significantly.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 15/20 - The tea wasn’t particularly forgiving, as seen with the reintroduction of bitterness in longer infusions. However, the shorter steeps were more successful, showing some flexibility.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 15/20 - There were variations in the experience across the infusions; the third infusion was notably better, indicating some inconsistency.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 15/30 - While the tea was pleasant, it wasn't particularly memorable or impressive. It was suitable for casual drinking but didn't excite or exceed expectations.

#### My recommendation: Would recommend for casual consumption.

# 57/100
